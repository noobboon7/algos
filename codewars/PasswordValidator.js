// You need to write regex that will validate a password to make sure it meets the following criteria:

// At least six characters long
// contains a lowercase letter
// contains an uppercase letter
// contains a number
// Valid passwords will only be alphanumeric characters.

function validate(password) {
	return /^(?=.*?[A-Z])(?=.*?[a-z])(?=.*?[0-9])[A-Za-z0-9]{6,}$/.test(password);

// ^               # start of input 
// (?=.*?[A-Z])    # Lookahead to make sure there is at least one upper case letter
// (?=.*?[a-z])    # Lookahead to make sure there is at least one lower case letter
// (?=.*?[0-9])    # Lookahead to make sure there is at least one number
// [A-Za-z0-9]{6,} # Make sure there are at least 6 characters of [A-Za-z0-9]
// $               # end of input
